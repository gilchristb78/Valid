# You need to nextgen-solitaire\run and then start a browser looking for localhost:9000 which requests recompilation

# Provided here so users can "debug" using a web-based interface that provides additional information
# about the repository. To make this work, in the sbt shell terminal, type "run" or possibly "nextgen/run"
# which starts a web server that processes these requests. Then type "http://localhost:3000/minimal" to
# trigger this behavior.
