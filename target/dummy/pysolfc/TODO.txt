1. Need to integrate press moves into python solutions

 Difficulty: medium

   a) must take over the TalonStack construction and do away with WasteTalonStock
   b) add logic to handle DealDeckMove and ResetDeckMove

   c) eventually try to deal with FlipCardMove, although PysolFC might automatically execute these moves.

   Look at internal ability to reset deck:

           am = ATurnStackMove(from_stack, to_stack)
           self.__storeMove(am)
           am.do(self)

    and look at turnStackMove in stack.py
